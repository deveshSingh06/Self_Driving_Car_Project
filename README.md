## About The Self Driving Car Project
- This project is the implementation of this [Nvidia paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf), with modifications as per the hardware constraints.
- We try to build a minimal version of a self driving car.
- For this project:
  - The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-KJCaaF7elleG1RbzVPZWV4Tlk/view). <br> (Credits to [Sully Chen](https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow) for providing the dataset for educational purposes) 
  - The dataset contains:
    - 45,406 front camera view images
      - Each image contains the steering angle
- To build this project, we build a Convolution Neural Network, a deep learning architecture, model.
- Using this model, the computer predicts the steering angle to avoid all sorts of collisions.


### Additional Information

-  This larger dataset (70 minutes of data ~ 223GB) could also be taken to implement a self driving car:
